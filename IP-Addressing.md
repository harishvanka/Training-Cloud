## IP Address
* An IP address is an address used in order to uniquely identify a device on an IP network. 
* The address is made up of 32 binary bits, which can be divisible into a network portion and host portion with the help of a subnet mask. 
* The 32 binary bits are broken into four octets (1 octet = 8 bits). Each octet is converted to decimal and separated by a period (dot). 
* For this reason, an IP address is said to be expressed in dotted decimal format (for example, 172.16.81.100). 
* The value in each octet ranges from 0 to 255 decimal, or 00000000 - 11111111 binary.

## Here is how binary octets convert to decimal:
* The right most bit, or least significant bit, of an octet holds a value of 2^0
* The address is made up of 32 binary bits, which can be divisible into a network portion and host portion with the help of a subnet mask.
